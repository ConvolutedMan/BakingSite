        <h1>Tuxedo Brownies (for when a casual brownie won't do)</h1>

    <p> I have a love/hate relationship with these brownies. On one hand they are delicious and are generally crowd pleasers. On the other hand these are a pain in the ass to make.

    <br>
    <p>You'll notice that the first ingredient is a pack of brownie mix, that's because this recipe is more about the filling than the brownie. If you want a brownie recipe you 
      can find one <a href  ="../Brownies/chocolateBrownies.html">here</a>.

            <h3>helpful hints and tricks</h3>
            <p>
              I cannot stress how important using a flour spray on the muffin pan is! It makes getting the brownies out of the pan significantly easier 
            </p>
            <p>
              When filling the pan with batter, I used to use a cookie scoop filled about halfway. However, lately I've taken to using a pancake batter dropper.  
           </p>
           <p>
              I use a plastic measuring spoon to indent the brownies. I find using metal causes the brownies to stick to the metal and tear them. 
           </p>
           <p>
             Speaking of getting the brownies out of the pan, I will generally try to twist them out, but if that doesn't work try loosening it with a butter knife. There is a strong 
             chance you'll tear a few brownies at this point. I still do all the time. 
           </p>
           <p>
              When filling the brownie cups with filling, I use a piping bag, but you can use whatever you want. 
           </p>
                       
            <p>
              *Genrally speaking adding a single egg to brownies will make them cake like. 
            </p>
            <p>
              **I actually like to make my own whipped cream. Take 1 Cup heavy whipping cream and beat it until stiff peaks form. Add about 1/8 Cup sugar and 1 capful of vanilla. 
              Add more sugar or vanilla if you are unsatisfied with the taste.
