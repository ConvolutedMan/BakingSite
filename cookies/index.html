            <h3>helpful hints and tricks</h3>
            <p>
                I generally bake for about 8 minutes, making sure to turn the pans at the halfway point.
                 This is crucial if you use a gas oven. It’s less important if you have a convection oven, but it’s still good practice since it lets you check on the cookies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you use butter, you will want to chill the cookie dough before you bake it. This will help control spread and will keep your cookies softer.
            </p>
            <p>I prefer to use dark non-stick Airbake pans, I find they are much more consistent at evenly distributing heat. 
                If you use aluminum pans, you may need to add another minute both to baking time and time on pan before moving to cooling rack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use a metal spatula when removing cookies. If you use plastic, melted chocolate will clump onto it making it harder to cleanly get your cookies off the sheet.
            </p>
